# Politer Ai Web site

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It follows
the [Build and Deploy a GPT-3 App in NextJS in 1 Hour (ChatGPT, TypeScript)](https://youtu.be/5i1Q2GSqidU?si=yJQPo4ToK31t9wEy)
by Coding in Flow YouTube channel.

## Features
* openai
* TypeScript
* ESLint
* CSS modules
* Styling

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you must have Node.js on your machine.
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed
on [http://localhost:3000/api/polite](http://localhost:3000/api/polite). This endpoint can be edited
in `pages/api/polite.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated
as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and
load Inter, a custom Google Font.
